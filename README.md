# My Social Media App

## Project Overview

My Social Media App is a personal project aimed at creating a mobile client-server application that allows users to connect, share posts, and interact with each other. The application is built using React Native for the mobile client and a GraphQL server for handling backend operations. This project serves as an opportunity to showcase my skills in mobile app development and backend programming, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

- **server**: Contains the GraphQL server that manages data, user authentication, and other backend functionalities.
- **app**: Contains the React Native mobile application, providing a seamless and user-friendly interface for user interaction.

## Key Features

This social media app includes the following features:

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to create an account.
- **User Login**: Enables existing users to sign in securely.
- **Add Post**: Users can create and share posts with their followers.
- **Show Posts**: Displays posts, sorted by the latest updates.
- **Comment on Posts**: Users can comment on posts, with comments stored as embedded documents for seamless integration.
- **Search Users**: Allows users to search for others by name or username.
- **Follow/Unfollow Users**: Users can follow or unfollow others to customize their feed.
- **Display Followers and Following**: Shows a list of followers and following for each user using reference lookups.
- **Like Posts**: Users can like posts, with a count showing the total likes each post has received.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native for the mobile client.
- **Backend**: GraphQL server for managing queries and mutations.
- **Database**: MongoDB for data storage.
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication using JWT.
- **API Communication**: GraphQL for efficient data querying between the client and server.

## Deployment & Future Improvements

This project can be further enhanced with the following improvements:

- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for likes, comments, and new followers.
- **Media Uploads**: Support for uploading images and videos in posts.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Improving the mobile app's interface for a more engaging user experience.
